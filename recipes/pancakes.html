        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>"This is a great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite." - Dakota</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>My Own Two Cents</h2>

        <p>Make sure to know how many people you are making pancakes for, because they are more filling than you think!</p>
